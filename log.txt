 cover all concepts, so conceptwise you will be covered in depth as you 
would have solved 450+ problems. After that, it depends on your skill 
set, if you can tackle a new problem on the same concept, ideally you 
should be able to.Is this a language specific course?Striver
 has made sure that the lectures are not language based, he teaches you 
the alogrithms. Post that he writes the pseudocodes, which are language 
independent. Loops and data structures are similar in every language, so
 you can always have the articles open on a parallel tab to check the 
code for C++, Java, Python or Javascript.How do I get my doubts resolved?If
 you have any doubts, you can always open the youtube comments, and read
 through. Mostly all the common doubts are there in the YouTube section.
 If you still have doubts, we will highly encourage you to use 
technology, and open Gemini/ChatGPT, and paste the code from our 
article, and ask them the doubt. This works for most of the use cases. 
If you still have doubt, you can post on the youtube comments, Striver 
usually replies if the community has not.What is the difference between Strivers SDE Sheet vs Strivers A2Z DSA Course?The
 Strivers SDE sheet is for people who have interviews in near future, 
and they are already versed with DSA basics. The Strivers A2Z DSA Course
 is for people who are starting of, or they want to practice more 
problems on concepts.Do I need to pay anything?As
 of today, every thing on takeUforward is free, however we will be happy
 if you give us a shoutout if the content helps you. That will mean a 
world to us.This
 course is made for people who want to learn DSA from A to Z for free in
 a well-organized and structured manner. The lecture quality is better 
than what you get in paid courses, the only thing we don’t provide is 
doubt support, but trust me our YouTube video comments resolve that as 
well, we have a wonderful community of 250K+ people who engage in all of
 the videos.Key HighlightsTeaches you problem solving by diving deep into DSA, with 450+ modules.In-depth video solutions covering brute, better, optimal solutions.Well structured articles/notes for quick revision.C++, Java, Python, and Javascript code.Company tags associated with each problem.Notes section to save your notes for quick revision.Used by over 1.5M+ people worldwide in the last 1 year.All the lectures are recorded in 4K.None of the paid/unpaid courses have these many modules.NoteThe Series doesn’t focus on any specific programming language. Instead, it emphasizes logic and uses pseudocode.The
 first two basic videos might use C++, but for Java tutorials, you can 
watch other YouTube videos. When tackling core problems of data 
structures and algorithms (DSA), the Series uses pseudocode that isn’t 
tied to any particular programming language.However, you can find code examples in your preferred language in the notes and articles provided.Your Progress: 0/4550%  completeShow RevisionStep 1 :

 cover all concepts, so conceptwise you will be covered in depth as you 
would have solved 450+ problems. After that, it depends on your skill 
set, if you can tackle a new problem on the same concept, ideally you 
should be able to.Is this a language specific course?Striver
 has made sure that the lectures are not language based, he teaches you 
the alogrithms. Post that he writes the pseudocodes, which are language 
independent. Loops and data structures are similar in every language, so
 you can always have the articles open on a parallel tab to check the 
code for C++, Java, Python or Javascript.How do I get my doubts resolved?If
 you have any doubts, you can always open the youtube comments, and read
 through. Mostly all the common doubts are there in the YouTube section.
 If you still have doubts, we will highly encourage you to use 
technology, and open Gemini/ChatGPT, and paste the code from our 
article, and ask them the doubt. This works for most of the use cases. 
If you still have doubt, you can post on the youtube comments, Striver 
usually replies if the community has not.What is the difference between Strivers SDE Sheet vs Strivers A2Z DSA Course?The
 Strivers SDE sheet is for people who have interviews in near future, 
and they are already versed with DSA basics. The Strivers A2Z DSA Course
 is for people who are starting of, or they want to practice more 
problems on concepts.Do I need to pay anything?As
 of today, every thing on takeUforward is free, however we will be happy
 if you give us a shoutout if the content helps you. That will mean a 
world to us.This
 course is made for people who want to learn DSA from A to Z for free in
 a well-organized and structured manner. The lecture quality is better 
than what you get in paid courses, the only thing we don’t provide is 
doubt support, but trust me our YouTube video comments resolve that as 
well, we have a wonderful community of 250K+ people who engage in all of
 the videos.Key HighlightsTeaches you problem solving by diving deep into DSA, with 450+ modules.In-depth video solutions covering brute, better, optimal solutions.Well structured articles/notes for quick revision.C++, Java, Python, and Javascript code.Company tags associated with each problem.Notes section to save your notes for quick revision.Used by over 1.5M+ people worldwide in the last 1 year.All the lectures are recorded in 4K.None of the paid/unpaid courses have these many modules.NoteThe Series doesn’t focus on any specific programming language. Instead, it emphasizes logic and uses pseudocode.The
 first two basic videos might use C++, but for Java tutorials, you can 
watch other YouTube videos. When tackling core problems of data 
structures and algorithms (DSA), the Series uses pseudocode that isn’t 
tied to any particular programming language.However, you can find code examples in your preferred language in the notes and articles provided.Your Progress: 0/4550%  completeShow RevisionStep 1 :

 cover all concepts, so conceptwise you will be covered in depth as you 
would have solved 450+ problems. After that, it depends on your skill 
set, if you can tackle a new problem on the same concept, ideally you 
should be able to.Is this a language specific course?Striver
 has made sure that the lectures are not language based, he teaches you 
the alogrithms. Post that he writes the pseudocodes, which are language 
independent. Loops and data structures are similar in every language, so
 you can always have the articles open on a parallel tab to check the 
code for C++, Java, Python or Javascript.How do I get my doubts resolved?If
 you have any doubts, you can always open the youtube comments, and read
 through. Mostly all the common doubts are there in the YouTube section.
 If you still have doubts, we will highly encourage you to use 
technology, and open Gemini/ChatGPT, and paste the code from our 
article, and ask them the doubt. This works for most of the use cases. 
If you still have doubt, you can post on the youtube comments, Striver 
usually replies if the community has not.What is the difference between Strivers SDE Sheet vs Strivers A2Z DSA Course?The
 Strivers SDE sheet is for people who have interviews in near future, 
and they are already versed with DSA basics. The Strivers A2Z DSA Course
 is for people who are starting of, or they want to practice more 
problems on concepts.Do I need to pay anything?As
 of today, every thing on takeUforward is free, however we will be happy
 if you give us a shoutout if the content helps you. That will mean a 
world to us.This
 course is made for people who want to learn DSA from A to Z for free in
 a well-organized and structured manner. The lecture quality is better 
than what you get in paid courses, the only thing we don’t provide is 
doubt support, but trust me our YouTube video comments resolve that as 
well, we have a wonderful community of 250K+ people who engage in all of
 the videos.Key HighlightsTeaches you problem solving by diving deep into DSA, with 450+ modules.In-depth video solutions covering brute, better, optimal solutions.Well structured articles/notes for quick revision.C++, Java, Python, and Javascript code.Company tags associated with each problem.Notes section to save your notes for quick revision.Used by over 1.5M+ people worldwide in the last 1 year.All the lectures are recorded in 4K.None of the paid/unpaid courses have these many modules.NoteThe Series doesn’t focus on any specific programming language. Instead, it emphasizes logic and uses pseudocode.The
 first two basic videos might use C++, but for Java tutorials, you can 
watch other YouTube videos. When tackling core problems of data 
structures and algorithms (DSA), the Series uses pseudocode that isn’t 
tied to any particular programming language.However, you can find code examples in your preferred language in the notes and articles provided.Your Progress: 0/4550%  completeShow RevisionStep 1 : Learn the basics0 /31Lec 1: Things to Know in C++/Java/Python or any language0 /9StatusProblemArticleYoutubePracticeNoteDifficultyRevision<

 cover all concepts, so conceptwise you will be covered in depth as you 
would have solved 450+ problems. After that, it depends on your skill 
set, if you can tackle a new problem on the same concept, ideally you 
should be able to.Is this a language specific course?Striver
 has made sure that the lectures are not language based, he teaches you 
the alogrithms. Post that he writes the pseudocodes, which are language 
independent. Loops and data structures are similar in every language, so
 you can always have the articles open on a parallel tab to check the 
code for C++, Java, Python or Javascript.How do I get my doubts resolved?If
 you have any doubts, you can always open the youtube comments, and read
 through. Mostly all the common doubts are there in the YouTube section.
 If you still have doubts, we will highly encourage you to use 
technology, and open Gemini/ChatGPT, and paste the code from our 
article, and ask them the doubt. This works for most of the use cases. 
If you still have doubt, you can post on the youtube comments, Striver 
usually replies if the community has not.What is the difference between Strivers SDE Sheet vs Strivers A2Z DSA Course?The
 Strivers SDE sheet is for people who have interviews in near future, 
and they are already versed with DSA basics. The Strivers A2Z DSA Course
 is for people who are starting of, or they want to practice more 
problems on concepts.Do I need to pay anything?As
 of today, every thing on takeUforward is free, however we will be happy
 if you give us a shoutout if the content helps you. That will mean a 
world to us.This
 course is made for people who want to learn DSA from A to Z for free in
 a well-organized and structured manner. The lecture quality is better 
than what you get in paid courses, the only thing we don’t provide is 
doubt support, but trust me our YouTube video comments resolve that as 
well, we have a wonderful community of 250K+ people who engage in all of
 the videos.Key HighlightsTeaches you problem solving by diving deep into DSA, with 450+ modules.In-depth video solutions covering brute, better, optimal solutions.Well structured articles/notes for quick revision.C++, Java, Python, and Javascript code.Company tags associated with each problem.Notes section to save your notes for quick revision.Used by over 1.5M+ people worldwide in the last 1 year.All the lectures are recorded in 4K.None of the paid/unpaid courses have these many modules.NoteThe Series doesn’t focus on any specific programming language. Instead, it emphasizes logic and uses pseudocode.The
 first two basic videos might use C++, but for Java tutorials, you can 
watch other YouTube videos. When tackling core problems of data 
structures and algorithms (DSA), the Series uses pseudocode that isn’t 
tied to any particular programming language.However, you can find code examples in your preferred language in the notes and articles provided.Your Progress: 0/4550%  completeShow RevisionStep 1 : Learn the basics0 /31Lec 1: Things to Know in C++/Java/Python or any language0 /9StatusProblemArticleYoutubePracticeNoteDifficultyRevision<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240510213845mp_/https://takeuforward.org/c/c-basic-input-output/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">User Input / Output<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240510213845mp_/https://takeuforward.org/c/c-basic-input-output/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" class="flex justify-center items-center text-zinc-700 dark:text-zinc-300"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240510213845mp_/https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/search-query-auto-complete/0?category%5B%5D=Strings&amp;category%5B%5D=Strings&amp;problemStatus=unsolved&amp;difficulty%5B%5D=2&amp;page=1&amp;query=category%5B%5DStringsproblemStatusunsolveddifficulty%5B%5D2page1category%5B%5DStr" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">
