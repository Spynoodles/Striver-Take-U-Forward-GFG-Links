So here is the entire story in short 

-> Idk why but striver removed the links for the problems that were only available on gfg
-> Frustruation to google the problems
-> Neuron activation ; went to waybackmachine to download an older archive of takeuforward 
**-> The script Scraps the data from the older archive so We get the gfg links back**
-> Long live waybackmachine 
-> Long live Striver
