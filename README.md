Striver’s GFG Links Are Back – Thanks to Wayback Machine
The Story (in short):

    For some reason, Striver removed the GFG-only problem links from TakeUForward.

    Googling each problem manually was frustrating.

    I used the Wayback Machine to retrieve the older archived version of the page.

    This script scrapes those archived pages and restores the missing GFG links.

    Long live the Wayback Machine.

    Long live Striver.

What’s in this repo:

    archived_file.html – a snapshot of the old TakeUForward site.

    scraper.py – the script that extracts the missing GFG links.

    Note: I do not own or maintain the original site or its content. This script is only for educational and restoration purposes.
